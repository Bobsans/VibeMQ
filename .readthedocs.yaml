# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details
#
# IMPORTANT: For multi-language support without i18n, you need to:
# 1. Create two separate projects in ReadTheDocs admin panel:
#    - Main project (Russian): vibemq (uses docs/ru/conf.py)
#    - Translation project (English): vibemq-en (uses docs/en/conf.py)
# 2. In the Russian project admin, go to Translations and add English project
# 3. Each project should have its own .readthedocs.yaml pointing to the correct conf.py
#
# For Russian project, use: sphinx.configuration: docs/ru/conf.py
# For English project, use: sphinx.configuration: docs/en/conf.py
